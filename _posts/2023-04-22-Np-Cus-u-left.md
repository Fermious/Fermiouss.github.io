This is what the marvelous Mrs. Maisel said to her ex-husband after he asked for another shot. His audacity to say "I'm thinking of giving it another go" baffles me; I am glad that she said 'No... Because You Left'. 

I really find what she did very attractive, it is yet another sign showing how great of a person she is, she is an exemplary woman. Additionally, I resonate to the situation, for reasons I will not disclose. If I were in her husband's shoes, I will really appreciate such rejection, it means that I fell in love with the right person, even if that very action means we are over. 

This series is so much fun, I like how I feel watching it, I feel slightly less happy because such quality of a series worth to be enjoyed by me and my spouse, I pray for her existence.
