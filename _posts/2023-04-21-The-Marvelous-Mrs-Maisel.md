# _The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel_
Well well well; I just started a very interesting series. _The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel_, and oh boy, does it feel good!

Funny story: before I dump my initial thoughts. I accidentally watched the $1^{st}$ episode of the $5^{th}$ season. I didn't feel anything weird, the show seemed decent and fun, but, here how I knew I skipped four fucking seasons:

$$Boobs$$

That's right, I have seen a clip of the $1^{st}$ episode that feature her gorgeous, fantastic, inhumanly beautiful boobs! So, when I finished the $1^{st}$ episode of the $5^{th}$ season, I said hey! I didn't see no boobs! So I asked a _friend_, with whom I share _scientific curiosities_, at which I realized my skip.

The show is pretty decent! I loved it immediately! I like her types of women, and oh God does she look stunning! I keep exclaiming because I am exclaimed! I can tell that this show is going to be one of my favorites of all times. It is one of the shows that gives me insights about myself, something I tend to be incapable of on my own.

I liked how in the beginning, she was writing notes about her husband's performance, and how she viewed his standup comedy as their 'couple thing'. She may not have the interest in comedy herself, but the supporting role she has shown is precious. I also like how she feels good about herself, I am attracted to such qualities. I hate her ex-husband though, he totally doesn't deserve her, and should go kill himself; how on earth can someone cheat on such a lovely lady! I am baffled.

tl;dr: The show is amazing and captivating, I will have a hell of fun watching it.
