# _Eigen’t do it anymore_

I am lost, in constant pain. This depression is degrading my mental health progressively. My mental health is deteriorating, so is my memory. 

During this vacation, I remembered how loneliness can depress me. No matter how hard I try to avoid feeling lonely, I end up feeling the fuck out of it. I have one friend that I have established a meaningful connection with. However, I deteriorate drastically when I am away from him. 

This is unacceptable, an extraordinary person such as myself should never rely on extra sources for his well being. I am trying my best to overcome this barrier, the human mortal need for human connection, and frankly it is looking impossible to overcome.

I have tried several ways to fulfill this need. Online and in real life, none is promising. The very few ones that look promising from a distance are the ones that are very toxic, and one sided. I am very tired of this. Eigen’t do it anymore.

The feeling that I am in a one sided relationships never leaves me. This haunts me and hunts me, corrupting the essence of my soul. I think I will recover if, and only if, I find a relationship were I am the one being clearly fought for. I never felt that, I always feel like I have to work hard to keep whatever good relationships I find.

What bugs me is, I cannot see a future where any of this change. Graduation? Getting a job? Pursuing higher degree? All of this feels the same to me, soulless, endless suffering. Eigen’t do it anymore.

Ironically, I have always had a remarkable relationship with none adult humans. Animals and children that is. I feel so good taking care of them, and I show them affection I show no one. To the point that one of my siblings said “I wish I was an animal so you can love me like them” which made me laugh.

Once upon a time, ‘love’ seemed like a way out of this hellhole. It wasn’t, it was a double edged sword that easily cut through my soul. Frankly, I do not think I will ever fall in love again. Which is sad and funny, and reassuring. Knowing that I won’t find love, reassures me that I know how fucked up I am. 

I mean look at me, writing in this blog for strangers to read. What is the point of this? What is the point of every kind of human connection? Nothing make sense to me. Eigen’t do this anymore.
