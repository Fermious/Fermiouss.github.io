# _Shoving the letters' agenda into video games, a hot take:_
> I am a muslim, I do not approve nor support the letters agenda; to think otherwise is absurd.

Recently, video games industry have been eager to shove TRANS / LGTV agenda into their games, in a clear propagandish approach. Consequently, they are getting bashed on for such actions, which is understandable. 

However, I just had a thought, what if we treat their agenda the same way as we treat other Haram, outrageous stuff, like rape or killing. Gamers, especially muslim gamers, always attack everyone who even remotely attributes the violent tendencies in the youth to video games, or the claims that such games normalizes violence. How come we cannot do the same for TRANS / LGTV agenda shoving?

I think, even knowingly that developers shove such agenda for the purpose of corrupting the mind of the youth, that we should not have such severe reaction whenever we see a certain character suddenly being associated with these groups. I believe that such actions should be thought of as if the game developers made your character a serial killer: a very bad thing that does in fact exist which we do not support nor accept irl.
