# _This workflow is a bit tiring_
I think I am using this the wrong way, this setup of my blog seems very inefficient. I will walk you through it:

$\texttt{I open the repository of which this blog is hosted by}$ $\rightarrow$ $\texttt{I open VSCode}$ $\rightarrow$ $\texttt{I create a new file in this format: YYYY-MM-DD-Title.md}$ $\rightarrow$ $\texttt{I write the post, in Markdown language}$ $\rightarrow$ $\texttt{I save and push the post}$ $\rightarrow$ $\texttt{It is LIVE!}$ $\square$
