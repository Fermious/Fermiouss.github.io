# _This workflow is a bit tiring_
I think I am using this the wrong way, this setup of my blog seems very inefficient. I will walk you through it:

$$\texttt{I open the repository of which this blog is hosted by}$$

$$\downarrow$$

$$\texttt{I open VSCode}$$

$$\downarrow$$

$$\texttt{I create a new file in this format: YYYY-MM-DD-Title.md}$$

$$\downarrow$$

$$\texttt{I write the post, in Markdown language}$$

$$\downarrow$$

$$\texttt{I save and push the post}$$

$$\downarrow$$

$$\texttt{It is LIVE!}$$

$$\square$$

_P.S. I have done this $\cancel{4}\cancel{5}\cancel{6}\cancel{7}8$ times already for this post_
