I am Ibraheem, I have a keen interest in the fundamental laws of nature and how they shape the world around us. I pursued a degree in physics as an undergraduate and found great satisfaction in the analytical and rigorous problem-solving approach that the field demands. My particular areas of focus include computational physics, condensed matter physics, and device physics.
